## Sections
This project will focus in three cornerstone aspects of blockchain technology. <br>
Using Bitcoin as an example, the authors will discuss Merkle Trees, Consensus, and Encryption.

### Merkle Trees
A Merkle tree is a data structure used in blockchain technology. <br>
The tree is constructed by recursively hashing pairs of leafs until reaching the top. <br>
The final hash is called the Merkle Root, and is a representation of all transactions included in a Bitcoin block. <br>
This project will include source code for obtaining data from www.blockchain.info using GET requests in python and recreating the Merkle Roof by recursively hashing the transactions in a block.

### Consensus
A consensus algorithm may be defined as the mechanism through which a blockchain network reaches consensus. Public blockchains are built as distributed systems for which they do not rely on a central authority, the distributed nodes need to agree on the validity of transactions. <br>
<br>
This is where consensus algorithms come into play. They assure that the protocol rules are being followed and guarantee that all transactions occur in a trustless way, so the coins are only able to be spent once. <br>
<br>
Consensus algorithms are crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of a cryptocurrency network. They provide a means of distributed nodes reaching consensus on which version of the blockchain is the real one. Agreeing upon the current blockchain state is essential for a digital economic system to work properly

### Encryption
Encryption is the process of encoding a message or information that only authorized parties can access, not allowing unauthorized personal to access. <br>
Bitcoin utilizes an encpryption based on the EllipticCurve Digital Signature Algorithm(ECDSA), along with the elliptic curve secp256k1. <br>
Bitcoin also utilizes The Secure Hash Algorithm(SHA) to hash transactions securely.<br>
There are a few variation of SHA consisting of SHA256 and SHA1 used in bitcoin.<br>
This project with analyze and compare different encryption methods that are used in bitcoins with other encpryption methods outside of bitcoin.<br>
