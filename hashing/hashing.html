			<h2>HASHING</h2>
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
				A cryptographic hashing function takes data of arbituray length <br>
				as input and produces an output of a fixed length known as a message digest or hash value.
				Bitcoin utilzes a specific flavor of cryptographic hashing function known as the SHA-256.	
			</p>
			<h3>SHA-256</h3>
			<p>	
				The SHA-256 is considered a one way hashing function. The ouput that is produced can not be used to 
				reverse the algorithm and aquire the input. This concept of SHA-256 being a one way function aids 
				in the security of bitcoin transactions.
			</p>
			<p>
				The SHA-256 belongs to a family of hashing functions known as the SHA-2 family. There are mutiple other hashing 
				functions under the SHA2 family(i.e SHA-224, SHA-512, SHA-384). The numeric suffix of each of these algorithms dictates
				the bit length of the hash value that is outputed, and each differs slightly in the way the hash value is create, however
				the basis of structure in the algorithms remains very much identical.
			</p>
			<h3>Algorithmic Process</h3>
			<p>
				In order to output a hash value the input is put through several steps to reach said output.
				<br>
				Step 1: Padding.
				Step 2: break input into block sizes of 512 bits.
				Step 3: Initialize registers.
				Step 4: Apply compression function.
