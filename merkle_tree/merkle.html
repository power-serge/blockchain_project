				<p>
					Let's begin with a simple concept: One-way <a href="../hashing/hashing.html" class="hashlink">hashing</a> functions.
				</p>
				<p>
					A one-way hashing function is a simple mechanism that takes in something as an input and produces a unique
					hash value for it. The hashing function we will be using is called SHA-256.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let's try it. Input some text into the box below and click the "Hash It!" button.
				</p>
				<input id="hash_it" type="text">
				<button onclick=hashIt(document.getElementById('hash_it').value)>Hash It!</button>
				<p id="hash_one"></p>
				<p>
					Whatever text you hashed, should always produce the same result. For instance, you can go to
					<a href="https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html" target="new">this</a> 
					website and enter the same text you entered in the "Hash It" box and you should
					get the same output.
				</p>
				<p>
					This presents a very interesting possibility. Could I also do this with a file?
					The answer is "Yes". You can put a file through a hashing function and get a hash value. 
					Then, other people can verify the contents of the file by downloading the file and using the 
					same hashing function to produce a hash value. Let's see an example.
				</p>
				<p>
					Imagine you have a simple zip archive with 4 files in it. The achive is on the web somewhere.
					You need to download it and make sure that the file downloaded correctly. In other words, you have
					to verify that the archive you have is the same as the one that was uploaded to the web site.
				</p>
				<p>
					The archive contains the following files:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><i>blockFunctions.js</i></li>
					<li><i>consensus.html</i></li>
					<li><i>index.html</i></li>
					<li><i>merkle.html</i></li>
				</ul>
				<img class="home_img mrkl" src="../imgs/zip_archive.jpg">
				<p>
					By using a hashing utility such as CRC SHA, which usually comes installed with <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/" target="new">7-zip</a>,
					we can hash the contents of the whole zip archive and get a result.
				</p>
				<img class="home_img mrkl" src="../imgs/crc_sha.jpg">
				<p>
					By clicking on the * simbol, we can get all the resulting hashes.
				</p>
				<img class="home_img mrkl"src="../imgs/checksum_info.jpg">
				<p>
					If you go to the <a href="https://github.com/power-serge/blockchain_project/blob/master/blockchain.7z">repo</a> 
					page, you can download this zip file and hash it. You should get the same results as shown on the image above.
